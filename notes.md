Web developers that respond to emails, finish the job and donâ€™t suck.

Web development, like many industries, is a vast and complex industry. We don't pretend to be experts in every technology stack and methodology. If we don't feel we can provide you with an adequate solution, we will happily refer you to someone who can.

### Our Process

Here at Insyte, we follow a method of web application development that allows us to build applications that are intuitive in their design and impactful in their functionality. We use an iterative model of software development that involves rapid development cycles. This allows us to quickly arrive at a minimum viable product and make constant improvements and feature additions. Our process can be broken into 5 primary stages: discovery, concept, architecture, development, handoff


#### Discovery

During the discovery or requirement gathering stage, we get to know you and your business. We will work together with you to gain a thorough understanding of the problem domain, the vision you have for the end result, and what you want to achieve. Once the task or problem is well understood, we draft a proposal or scope of work and technical specifications for your review. This will serve as a guide for our development process while we craft a solution that meets your needs.


#### Concept

Once out of the requirement gathering phase, we begin scaffolding the look and feel of your solution. We draw inspiration from your existing brand and latest design trends in the industry. Our team will work to provide you with options or variations so that you may choose a solution that most resembles your vision.


#### Architecture

In the architecture phase, we will begin to work out and put into place all of the pieces required to bring your vision to reality. This is the phase where our solution begins to take shape. While not a finished product, the work done during the architecture phase will lay the groundwork for a complete solution.


#### Development

This is where the magic happens. During the development stage, we bring together all of the pieces drafted during the architecture stage and put together a final product. This is also the phase in which we build out automated testing that will ensure the product does exactly what it should do, while handling unexpected inputs and errors in a graceful, user-friendly manner.


#### Handoff

The final step of our process is the handoff. During the handoff period, we ensure that we have met the requirements agreed upon during the initial discovery period and that you are satisfied with the final result. This is also the phase in which, if applicable, we provide training to your staff in using the software.
